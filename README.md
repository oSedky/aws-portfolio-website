## 💡 Why This Project Exists

This portfolio isn't just a static site, it's a **fully deployed AWS cloud project** demonstrating real-world infrastructure thinking. Built for **cost-efficiency**, **security**, and **scalability**, it mirrors production-grade decisions used by cloud architects.

Every element — S3, CloudFront, Route 53, ACM, GitHub — was configured with purpose and precision.

## 🧱 Architecture Steps (Condensed)

### 1. 🔐 IAM & Budgeting
- Created IAM user + enabled billing dashboard
- Set $20/month budget alert

### 2. 🌐 Domain & DNS
- Purchased `sedky.net` via Route 53
- Hosted zone set up for DNS control

### 3. 🪣 S3 Hosting
- Public bucket with static hosting
- Bucket policy configured for public read

### 4. 🚀 CloudFront & ACM
- CloudFront distribution pointing to S3  
- SSL certificate issued via ACM  
- HTTPS enabled with custom error response (404.html)

### 5. 🔒 DNS Integration
- A records pointed to CloudFront
- Verified via dig / nslookup

### 6. 📧 Email Deliverability
- Microsoft 365 MX + TXT + CNAME (SPF/DKIM/DMARC)
- Validated via headers + mail-tester.com (10/10)

---

## 💼 What I Gained

- Route 53 DNS troubleshooting  
- DKIM CNAME validation gotcha (auto-appending `.com`)  
- SSL best practices with ACM  
- Version control and manual deployment with AWS CLI  
- Portfolio clarity for recruiters and cloud teams  

---

## 📌 Next Steps

- More AWS projects (Lambda, SES, SageMaker, CI/CD, Alexa)
- Integrate GitHub Actions for automation
- Publish architecture stories on LinkedIn and GitHub
